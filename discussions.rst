Discussions
===========

Maybe we should put the discussions in issues...

Structure
=========

OOP (Oriented Object Programming) or functions or both (structure/models with OOP and computations with functions)?
Check performance and scale (e.g., object "wall", etc.)? Can we have as many objects as we would like?
How can we create a model (solar thermal combisystem) from others (pipe, pump, storage tank, etc.)?

Model
=====

Should we keep @abc.abstractmethod (on each function)?
- pros: show options to users / give opportunities
- cons: do not hide "complexity" / add code

Variable / Field
================

Variable was replaced by Field. The name is far from sexy.
